## Brief
You have been approached by a lifestyle consultancy company dealing with environmental sustainability. Your task is to build a personal CO<sub>2</sub> footprint checker app that calculates a user's CO<sub>2</sub> footprint based on their lifestyle.

A user should be able to:

* Submit values for various aspects of their lifestyle (e.g. diet, commute, recycling and heating routine, holiday habits, etc) and view their CO<sub>2</sub> footprint. A simple model should be created to calculate this.
* Update the values to see the effect on their CO<sub>2</sub> footprint.
* View the CO<sub>2</sub> footprint result in a visually interesting way.

The app should be able to:

* Calculate and visualise projections of CO<sub>2</sub> savings based on a user's input.
* Show the CO<sub>2</sub> footprint result before and after the user has updated the values.
